    <h1>College Football: A Battle Against Conference Realignment</h1>
    <h3>A brief history of college football and one of its biggest obstacles, including one that looms larger now than ever: conference realignment. </h3>
    
    <section id="realignment-details">
    <div class="history-block">
    <h2>The Stages of Realignment</h2>
    <p>To understand how we got here, we must look at the specific moves made by the "Power" conferences:</p>
    
    <ol class="realignment-list">
        <li><strong>Phase 1: The First Ripples (1990s - 2005)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The SEC creates the first Conference Championship game, sparking the need for more members.</li>
                <li>The ACC raids the Big East for Miami and Virginia Tech to bolster its football profile.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2: The Early 2010s Shift</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Nebraska leaves the Big 12 for the Big Ten, ending a century of regional tradition.</li>
                <li>Texas A&M and Missouri join the SEC, cementing the SEC as a massive media powerhouse.</li>
                <li>The Big East collapses as a football power, leading to the "American" (AAC) conference.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3: The Modern "Super-Conference" Era (Present Day)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The "Big Two" (SEC and Big Ten) begin massive expansion, adding USC, UCLA, and Texas.</li>
                <li>The Pac-12—the "Conference of Champions"—effectively dissolves as members flee for stability.</li>
                <li>Media rights deals reach the billion-dollar threshold, prioritizing TV markets over geography.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Major Conflict: Revenue vs. Tradition</h3>
    <p>
        The primary issue facing college football today is the <strong>death of regionality</strong>. For over a century, the sport was defined by neighbors playing neighbors, allowing fans to easily travel to away games and maintaining decades-old rivalries. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, with teams like Washington playing at Rutgers, or Stanford traveling to Syracuse, the travel burden on student-athletes has skyrocketed. Furthermore, the "revenue gap" is widening; as the Big Ten and SEC sign massive billion-dollar television deals, smaller conferences are being left behind, creating a two-tiered system that threatens the very fabric of the "any given Saturday" spirit.
